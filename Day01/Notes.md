# Notes for Day 01: Two Sum

## Approach

- Use a hash map to store the difference between the target and each element as we iterate through the array.
- Check if the current element exists in the hash map, which means we have found the two numbers that add up to the target.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)

## Key Learnings

- Importance of hash maps for quick lookups.
- Understanding how to approach problems with a time complexity constraint.
