# 120 Days DSA Challenge

Welcome to my 120-day Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) challenge repository! 

## Overview

This repository documents my journey of solving one DSA problem every day for 120 days. Each day's solution is stored in its own folder with the problem statement, solution, and any notes or insights.

## Repository Structure

- **DayXX/**: Contains the problem statement, solution, and notes for day XX.
  - `Problem.md`: The problem statement.
  - `Solution.js`: The solution code.
  - `Notes.md`: Any notes or insights about the problem.

## Progress

- [Day 01 - Two Sum](Day01/) 
- [Day 02 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](Day02/)
- [Day 03 - Find Kth largest element in an array](Day03/)
- [Day 04 - Rotate Array](Day04/)
- [Day 05 - Valid Palindrome](Day05/)
- [Day 06 - Reverse String](Day06/)
- [Day 07 - Implement strStr() (Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String)](Day07/)
- [Day 08 - Subarray Sum Equals K (Prefix Sums)](Day08/)
- [Day 09 - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](Day09/)
- [Day 10 - Container With Most Water (Two Pointer Technique)](Day10/)
- [Day 11 - Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (Binary Search)](Day11/)
- [Day 12 - Search in Rotated Sorted Array (Binary Search)](Day12/)
- [Day 13: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted(Hash Table)](Day13/)


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/nareshb7/120-days-dsa-challenge.git`
2. Navigate to the desired day: `cd DayXX`
3. Open the `Problem.md` to read the problem statement.
4. Review the solution in `Solution.js`.
5. Read any additional notes in `Notes.md`.
6. To run program use the command `node Solution.js`.
