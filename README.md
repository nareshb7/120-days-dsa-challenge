# 120 Days DSA Challenge

Welcome to my 120-day Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) challenge repository! 

## Overview

This repository documents my journey of solving one DSA problem every day for 120 days. Each day's solution is stored in its own folder with the problem statement, solution, and any notes or insights.

## Repository Structure

- **DayXX/**: Contains the problem statement, solution, and notes for day XX.
  - `Problem.md`: The problem statement.
  - `Solution.js`: The solution code.
  - `Notes.md`: Any notes or insights about the problem.

## Progress

- [Day 1](Day01/)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/nareshb7/120-days-dsa-challenge.git`
2. Navigate to the desired day: `cd DayXX`
3. Open the `Problem.md` to read the problem statement.
4. Review the solution in `Solution.java`.
5. Read any additional notes in `Notes.md`.
