# Day 14: Group Anagrams (Hash Table)

## Problem Statement

- Given an `array` of strings `strs`, group the `anagrams` together. You can return the answer in any order.
- An `Anagram` is a word or phrase `formed by rearranging the letters` of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Example

1. **Example1**
- Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
- Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

2. **Example 2:**
- Input: strs = [""]
- Output: [[""]]

3. **Example 3:**
- Input: strs = ["a"]
- Output: [["a"]]
