# Notes for Day 26: Reorder List

## Approach
- Base Case: If the list is empty or has only one node, return immediately since no reordering is needed.
- Finding the Middle: Use two pointers, slow and fast, to find the middle of the list. slow advances by one node while fast advances by two nodes. When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the middle.
- Splitting the List: Once the middle is found, split the list into two halves by setting prev.next to null. The first half starts at l1 (which is head), and the second half starts at slow.
- Reversing the Second Half: Reverse the second half of the list using the reverse function.
- Merging the Two Halves: Merge the first half and the reversed second half using the merge function.

## Complexity
- `Time Complexity: O(n)` Where n is the length of the linked list, Finding ther middle `O(n)`, Reversing the second half `O(n/2)`, Merging Two Halves `O(n)` .
- `Space Complexity: O(1)` The algorithm modifies the list in place and only uses a constant amount of extra space for pointers (prev, slow, fast, etc.).

## Key Learnings:
- `Two-pointer Technique:` Using the slow and fast pointers to find the middle of a linked list is a common and efficient approach. It splits the list in linear time, which is often the first step in problems involving linked lists.
- `Reversing a Linked List:` Reversing a linked list in place is a fundamental operation, and understanding how to do it efficiently is crucial for many linked list problems.
- `In-place Modification:` Modifying the linked list in place without using extra space is a key technique in optimizing space complexity. This problem reinforces the importance of manipulating pointers carefully.
- `Merging Two Linked Lists:` Merging two linked lists in a specific order (alternating nodes) is a good exercise in pointer manipulation. It requires careful attention to keep track of the next nodes and avoid losing reference to parts of the list.
- `Understanding Edge Cases:` The solution begins with a base case check to ensure the list isn't empty or doesn't consist of a single node. This is a crucial step to avoid unnecessary processing and potential errors.
- `Combination of Techniques:` This problem is a good example of combining multiple techniques (two-pointer, reversing, merging) to solve a more complex problem. It shows how breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable parts can simplify the solution.
- `In-Place Reordering:` The problem teaches how to reorder a linked list in place, which is an important skill for problems where memory usage is a concern.
