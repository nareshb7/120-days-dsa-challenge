# Day 31: Basic Calculator

## Problem Statement
- Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.
- Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval()

## Example

1. **Example 1:**
- Input: s = "1 + 1"
- Output: 2

2. **Example 2:**
- Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
- Output: 3

3. **Example 3:**
- Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
