# Day 42: Basic Calculator II

## Problem Statement

- Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value.
- The integer division should truncate toward zero.
- You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].
- Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

## Example

1. **Example 1:**

- Input: s = "3+2*2"
- Output: 7

2. **Example 2:**

- Input: s = " 3/2 "
- Output: 1

3. **Example 3:**
