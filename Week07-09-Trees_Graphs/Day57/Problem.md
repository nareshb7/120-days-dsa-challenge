# Day 57: Path Sum

## Problem Statement

- Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum,
- return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.
- A leaf is a node with no children.

## Example

1. **Example 1:**

- Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
- Output: true
- Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

2. **Example 2:**

- Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
- Output: false
- Explanation: There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
  (1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
  (1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
  There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.
