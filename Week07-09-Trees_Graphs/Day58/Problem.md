# Day 58: Find Mode in Binary Search Tree

## Problem Statement

- Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it.
- If the tree has more than one mode, return them in any order.
- Assume a BST is defined as follows:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees

## Example

1. **Example 1:**

- Input: root = [1,null,2,2]
- Output: [2]
