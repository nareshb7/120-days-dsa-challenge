# Day 59: Number of Islands

## Problem Statement

- Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
- An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

## Example

1. **Example 1:**

- Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
  ]
- Output: 1

2. **Example 2:**

- Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
  ]
- Output: 3
