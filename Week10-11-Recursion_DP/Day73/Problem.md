# Day 73: Jump Game

## Problem Statement

- You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
- Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

## Example

1. **Example 1:**

- Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
- Output: true
- Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

2. **Example 2:**

- Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
- Output: false
- Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index
