# Day 77: Sort Characters By Frequency

## Problem Statement

- Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.
- Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

## Example

1. **Example 1:**

- Input: s = "tree"
- Output: "eert"
- Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
  So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

3. **Example 2:**

- Input: s = "Aabb"
- Output: "bbAa"
- Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
  Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
