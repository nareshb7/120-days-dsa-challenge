# Day 84: Sort an array (Quick Sort)

## Problem Statement

- Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.
- You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible

## Example

1. **Example 1:**

- Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
- Output: [1,2,3,5]
- Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).
